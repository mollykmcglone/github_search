## Description

An Epicodus independent student project to practice building a modern Javascript app with a gulp-based asset pipeline and development server.

* Place your token in the .env file (i.e. exports.apiKey = "YOUR-KEY";)
* Include the .env file in .gitignore and require the apiKey variable in your js file(s).
```
